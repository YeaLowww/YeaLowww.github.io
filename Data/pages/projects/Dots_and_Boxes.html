        Dots_and_Boxes is a course project that I developed using Python. It is an implementation of the classic pencil-and-paper game where players can compete against computer-controlled bots of varying skill levels. The objective of the game is to connect dots to form boxes, and the player with the most boxes at the end of the game wins.

        During the development of Dots_and_Boxes, I gained valuable experience in several key areas:

        Python Programming: Strengthened my skills in Python, particularly in the areas of game development and AI programming.
        Algorithm Design: Developed and implemented various algorithms for the AI bots, enhancing my understanding of game theory and strategic decision-making.
        GUI Development: Gained practical experience in designing and implementing graphical user interfaces using libraries such as Tkinter or Pygame.
        Testing and Debugging: Improved my abilities to test and debug complex systems, ensuring that the game operates smoothly and without errors.

        Developing the Dots_and_Boxes project was a rewarding experience that broadened my understanding of game development and artificial intelligence. It challenged me to think creatively and strategically, both in terms of programming and game design. This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the complexities and nuances of creating engaging and intelligent games.
