        SmartEnemyAI is an artificial intelligence project designed to create intelligent enemy characters that can dynamically interact with the environment and respond to player actions in video games. The project is focused on improving the gaming experience by making enemy behavior more realistic and complex.
        <br>
        <br>
        SmartEnemyAI was implemented using Unreal Engine 5 and its Blueprint system. I really enjoyed this experience as it allowed me to explore and integrate different artificial intelligence methodologies into a coherent system, which was like putting together a complex puzzle, making the development process extremely interesting.

        <br>
        Working on this project significantly expanded my view of the possibilities of AI in games. It encouraged me to approach problem solving from different angles and consider how different AI strategies can be used to create a more immersive and interactive gaming environment. Each new technique I learned and implemented added a new level of depth to the AI's behavior, making enemies more realistic and unpredictable.

        <br>
        I feel that this project has greatly expanded my understanding of artificial intelligence and its application in game development. It made me look at AI programming in a new light, appreciating the possibilities it offers. In particular, every time I dive into a new AI technique, I try to understand it from the perspective of its creators and explore the unique features and benefits it offers. This approach has not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the art of AI development.
