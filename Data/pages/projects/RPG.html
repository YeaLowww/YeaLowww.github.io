        Developing a game on Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints inspired by the Assassin's Creed series was extremely exciting.
        This was a new experience for me, as it was my first time working with visual programming, and I felt that every stage of development was like solving a complex puzzle.
        <br>
        <br>
        This game combines stealth mechanics, parkour, and a combat system, as well as RPG elements such as character development and decision-making that affect the story and a lot of other features that needed to be implemented
        <br>
        <br>
        This project greatly expanded my understanding of the possibilities of game engines and game design.
        During my work, I tried to look at the game from the developers' point of view, analyzing what elements might be interesting or useful.
        I also looked for creative solutions for mechanics and gameplay, trying to implement interesting ideas using Blueprints.
        <br>
        <br>
        This experience inspired me to further study game engineering and opened new horizons in understanding programming.
