        I have studied and implemented the Gauss-Jordan algorithm for finding the inverse matrix and its parallel implementation. The analysis of the theoretical aspects of the algorithm, its complexity and efficiency made it possible to understand the basic principles and advantages of this method.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this work, I developed a program code for finding the inverse matrix using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm. A parallel version of the algorithm was also studied and implemented to speed up the calculations.
        <br>
        <br>
        The test results showed that the parallel implementation of the algorithm significantly speeds up the process of finding the inverse matrix compared to the conventional algorithm. The speedup depends on the size of the matrix, and in fact, the speedup of the parallel algorithm over the sequential algorithm is 2.75 times for matrices of size 5000×5000.
        <br>
        <br>
        In conclusion, i can note that the use of parallel computing allows efficient use of the resources of multicore systems and significantly reduces the time of calculating the inverse matrix, which makes the Gauss-Jordan algorithm interesting and promising for use in practical problems.
